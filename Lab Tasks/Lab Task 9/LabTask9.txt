A naturalist is off to explore the amazon jungle, and needs a computer program to record information about all the new species discovered. For each new species it is necessary to store the name (max 128 characters), size (a real number), and the type of animal (an enum type, one of mammal, insect, bird, or fish). Write a program to store and print out the information. (6.0%)

An array of structures must be used, so that each new species can be recorded in an element of the array. It's not known in advance how many new species will be found, so the program must malloc for an initial array of size 1, and use the doubling realloc technique (as discussed in class) to get more memory as required. You must always check the return value from malloc, as done in the Malloc wrapper function (or just use Malloc :-). Here what a sample run should look like (with the keyboard input shown in italics) ...
