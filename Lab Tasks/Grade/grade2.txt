-0.1 you created the links directory in your home directory, not the LabTask2 directory.

Globbing.txt
good job

Compile.txt
good job

Ticker.txt
good job

CSCCodes.txt
head can also take a file as an argument, so no need to use cat.
-0.1 you should use grep with -w in this case, it turns on word boundaries, meaning grep will only match whole words(or csc codes)

GrepExInts.txt
-0.1 your pattern allows multiple int definitions without commas
like this:
int aDog aCat;
which is invalid.

Permissions.txt
no need to use your .bashrc
good job!
