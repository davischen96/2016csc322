Since we talked about pointers, memory allocation and linked lists in class, I'd like you to write a program that allows the user to:

Enter the names of persons.
For each person entered, enter the name of his/her best buddy.
Print out the "best buddys"
Here what a sample run should look like (with the user input shown in italics) ...
Enter nation name : Tom
Enter nation name : Betty 
Enter nation name : Martin
Enter nation name : Michael
Enter nation name : Amanda
Enter nation name : Catharine
Enter nation name : 
Enter best ally name for Catharine : Amanda
Enter best ally name for Amanda : Michael
Enter best ally name for Michael : Martin
Enter best ally name for Martin : Betty
Enter best ally name for Betty : Amanda
Enter best ally name for Tom : Catharine 
The best ally of Catharine is Amanda
The best ally of Amanda is Michael
The best ally of Michael is Martin
The best ally of Martin is Betty
The best ally of Betty is Amanda
The best ally of Tom is Catharine 
You must ...

Implement the program in C. (5.0%)
Each person's name entered must be stored in a node of a linked list.
Each node of the linked list must contain (only) the persons name, a pointer to the node for its best buddy, and a pointer to the next node in the list.
Before the program completes it must explicitly free the malloced memory.
